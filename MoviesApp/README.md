# Movies app.
This application works with the unofficial API of the Kinopoisk website. All detailed documentation can be found here: https://api.kinopoisk.dev

The application allows you to view the main up-to-date information about all available films on the site.

In this project I use the following technologies:
- RxJava
- Retrofit
- Room
- Glide

## Home page and search:
   Here you are offered to go to the movie search, look at the section with your favorite movies, and also see the selection offered to you for today.
